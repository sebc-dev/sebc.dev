## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 36 requirements following strict dependency chain (foundation -> pages by reuse order -> polish)
- [Roadmap]: SEO requirements grouped in final phase for cross-page consistency verification
- [Roadmap]: Responsive (INFR-03) and contrast (INFR-04) placed in Phase 1 as foundational constraints

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Pagefind custom search UI integration with Astro is MEDIUM confidence -- may need API docs review during Phase 4 planning
- [Research]: About page mockup (about.html) must be redesigned -- do not implement as-is
- [Research]: Trailing slash config must be validated on Cloudflare Pages staging early
