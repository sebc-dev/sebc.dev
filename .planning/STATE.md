## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 36 requirements following strict dependency chain (foundation -> pages by reuse order -> polish)
- [Roadmap]: SEO requirements grouped in final phase for cross-page consistency verification
- [Roadmap]: Responsive (INFR-03) and contrast (INFR-04) placed in Phase 1 as foundational constraints
- [01-01]: Followed official Astro i18n recipe pattern -- no custom abstractions for 2 languages
- [01-01]: GlowLine accepts optional class prop for flexible composition across components
- [01-02]: Used text-teal-bright (not text-teal) for logo and active states -- WCAG AA on all backgrounds
- [01-02]: Social icons use text-secondary hover:text-teal-bright instead of mockup text-muted for WCAG
- [01-02]: LangSwitch renders as anchor tags since each option navigates to a localized URL
- [01-03]: BaseLayout uses min-h-screen flex-col pattern to push footer to bottom on short pages
- [01-03]: Scroll-reveal script wrapped in astro:page-load event for View Transitions compatibility
- [01-03]: Root 404 page defaults to English since it handles unprefixed URLs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Pagefind custom search UI integration with Astro is MEDIUM confidence -- may need API docs review during Phase 4 planning
- [Research]: About page mockup (about.html) must be redesigned -- do not implement as-is
- [Research]: Trailing slash config must be validated on Cloudflare Pages staging early
