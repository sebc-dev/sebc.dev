## The Limits of Traditional Linting

Static analysis tools catch syntax errors and style violations, but they miss the intent behind code. A function can pass every lint rule and still be poorly named, inefficiently structured, or misaligned with the project's architecture. This is where AI-assisted review steps in.

## What AI Brings to the Table

Modern AI code review tools analyze pull requests with semantic understanding. They can flag logic errors, suggest better abstractions, and identify patterns that diverge from the codebase's conventions. The key advantage is context-awareness -- the AI understands not just the diff, but how it fits into the broader system.

## Practical Integration

The most effective teams treat AI review as a first pass, not a replacement for human reviewers. Let the AI catch the mechanical issues -- naming inconsistencies, missing error handling, test coverage gaps -- so human reviewers can focus on architecture, business logic, and mentoring. This division of labor makes the entire review cycle faster and more thorough.
