## Developer UX Is Still UX

Developer tools often get a pass on usability because their users are technical. This is backwards -- developers switching between dozens of tools daily have less patience for poor UX, not more. Every unnecessary click, ambiguous label, or hidden setting adds cognitive load to an already demanding workflow.

## The Three Types of Cognitive Load

Intrinsic load comes from the task itself and can't be reduced. Extraneous load comes from poor interface design and should be eliminated. Germane load comes from building mental models and should be supported. A well-designed dashboard minimizes extraneous load (clear labels, consistent layout, obvious navigation) while supporting germane load (progressive disclosure, contextual help, sensible defaults).

## Practical Patterns

Show the most-used actions first. Use progressive disclosure to hide advanced options behind expandable sections. Provide keyboard shortcuts for power users but don't require them. Default to the safe option. Show real examples instead of abstract descriptions. Use color meaningfully -- not decoratively -- to encode status and severity.
