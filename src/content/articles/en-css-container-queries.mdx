## The Problem with Media Queries

Media queries respond to the viewport, not the component's container. This means a card component that looks great in a full-width layout breaks when placed in a narrow sidebar -- because the viewport hasn't changed, only the available space has.

Container queries let you style elements based on the size of their parent container. Define a containment context with `container-type: inline-size`, then use `@container` rules to adapt the component's layout to the space it actually occupies.

## Adopting Container Queries Today

Browser support for container queries has reached baseline status. You can start using them in production alongside media queries -- use media queries for page-level layout shifts and container queries for component-level adaptations. The two complement each other perfectly.
