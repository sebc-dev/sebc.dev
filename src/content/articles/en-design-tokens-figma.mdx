## The Token Translation Problem

Designers define colors, spacing, and typography in Figma. Engineers consume them as CSS custom properties, Tailwind theme values, or platform-specific constants. The gap between these two worlds is where inconsistencies creep in -- a designer updates a color, but the code still references the old value three sprints later.

## Building the Pipeline

The modern token pipeline has three stages: extraction, transformation, and distribution. Extract tokens from Figma using the Variables API, transform them through Style Dictionary into platform-specific formats, and distribute via npm packages or CI-driven pull requests.

```json
{
  "color": {
    "primary": {
      "$value": "#0d9488",
      "$type": "color",
      "$description": "Brand teal, used for CTAs and links"
    },
    "surface": {
      "$value": "#0a0a0f",
      "$type": "color",
      "$description": "Main background color"
    }
  }
}
```

## Keeping Tokens in Sync

The pipeline is only as good as its automation. Set up a webhook that triggers on Figma file changes, runs the extraction script, and opens a PR with the updated tokens. Engineers review the diff, see exactly which values changed, and merge with confidence. No more manual copy-paste from design specs.
