## Why the Edge Matters

Moving computation closer to users reduces latency, but the benefits depend heavily on your workload. Static asset caching at the edge is a no-brainer. Dynamic request handling at the edge is where things get interesting -- and where architectural decisions matter most.

## Pattern: Edge-Side Personalization

Instead of routing every request to a central origin for personalization, parse the user's context at the edge. Geolocation, device type, and cookie-based preferences can all be resolved in a Worker without hitting your origin server. Combine this with HTMLRewriter for surgical DOM modifications and you get personalized pages at CDN speed.

## Pattern: Edge-Side Rate Limiting

Rate limiting at the edge prevents abusive traffic from ever reaching your origin. Using Durable Objects for distributed counters gives you consistent rate limiting across all edge locations without a centralized database. The tradeoff is eventual consistency -- but for rate limiting, a few extra requests slipping through during counter synchronization is acceptable.

## When to Stay at the Origin

Not everything belongs at the edge. Complex database transactions, long-running computations, and stateful session management are better served by traditional server infrastructure. The edge excels at read-heavy, latency-sensitive, stateless operations. Know your workload before distributing it.
