## The Promise and the Reality

Micro-frontends promise independent deployability, team autonomy, and technology diversity. In practice, they deliver those benefits only at scale -- when you have 5+ teams working on the same product. For smaller teams, the operational overhead outweighs the organizational benefits.

## Composition Approaches

The three dominant approaches are build-time composition (Module Federation), server-side composition (edge-side includes or server rendering), and client-side composition (Web Components or iframe-based). Each has distinct tradeoffs in performance, isolation, and developer experience. Module Federation offers the best DX but couples teams at build time. Server-side composition gives true independence but adds infrastructure complexity.

## Shared Dependencies: The Hidden Cost

The biggest pain point in micro-frontend architectures is dependency management. When three micro-frontends each bundle their own React version, you ship megabytes of duplicate code. Shared dependency maps solve this but create implicit coupling. The pragmatic approach: share framework-level dependencies, isolate everything else.

## When to Say No

If your product has fewer than four contributing teams, a well-structured monolith with clear module boundaries will serve you better. Micro-frontends are an organizational scaling strategy, not a technical improvement. Don't adopt the architecture until you have the problem it solves.
