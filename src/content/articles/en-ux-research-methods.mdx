## The Research-Shipping Gap

Most UX research never makes it into production. Studies produce beautiful slide decks that get presented once and forgotten. The problem isn't the research quality -- it's the format. Engineers need actionable findings, not academic reports.

## Five Methods That Work

The most impactful research methods for shipping teams are: guerilla usability tests (5 users, 15 minutes each), session recordings with click heatmaps, A/B tests with clear success metrics, support ticket analysis for recurring pain points, and Jobs-to-be-Done interviews that reveal the "why" behind user behavior.

## From Insight to Implementation

Every research finding should produce a concrete artifact: a user story, a design spec, or a test case. If a research session reveals that users struggle with a multi-step form, the output isn't "users find the form confusing" -- it's a specific proposal to split the form into three focused steps, with acceptance criteria and mockups attached.
