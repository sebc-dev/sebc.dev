## Why Accessibility Gets Deprioritized

Teams know accessibility matters, but it often falls to the bottom of the backlog. The root cause is usually a lack of concrete, framework-specific guidance. Generic WCAG documentation doesn't tell you how to make your React combobox keyboard-navigable or how to announce route changes in a single-page app.

## Component-Level Patterns

Every interactive component needs three things: keyboard support, ARIA semantics, and focus management. A dropdown menu should open with Enter or Space, navigate with arrow keys, and close with Escape. The trigger button needs `aria-expanded` and `aria-haspopup`. Focus should move into the menu on open and return to the trigger on close.

## Testing Accessibility

Automated tools like axe-core catch about 30% of accessibility issues. The rest requires manual testing with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. Build both into your CI pipeline and your QA process. Run axe in your integration tests, and schedule regular screen reader audits with real assistive technology users.
